# Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning
This is graduation project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. 
In this project, code developed for an image classifier built with PyTorch using Jupyter notebook, then converted into a command line applications: train.py, predict.py.
The project is divided into :
  - Training file : that aim to training the machine to distinguish between different images     
  - predict file :test the accuracy of the model in image recognition
